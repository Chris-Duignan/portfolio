      <p>
        Hi, I&apos;m Chris, Software/ Data Engineer, and board game enthusiast. I
        began my switch into tech in August 2023, completing the Northcoders
        Software Engineering bootcamp. After finishing the course, I moved into
        a role with Northcoders and worked with a client as a frontend software
        engineer. After finishing work with the client, I moved into learning
        the fundamentals of data engineering, and cloud infrastructure (AWS,
        Microsoft Azure).
      </p>
